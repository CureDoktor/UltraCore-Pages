          <p class="textField3Two pt-4 pb-2">Male Ultracore takes pride as the safest testosterone booster available in the market formulated using all-natural ingredients. Several supplement products claim to increase T levels but contain chemicals that are bad for
            your health.</br></br> The all-natural ingredients in Male Ultracore ensure you of a pure, quality product. It will give you newer energy in sex, as well as a healthy lean body.</br></br>

           <span class="font-weight-bold"> Tongkat Ali</span> is a popular plant used in traditional medicine in Southeast Asia. Studies have shown it helps resolve erectile dysfunction and helps improve stamina, libido, and size. It helps increase testosterone production that encourages stronger and fuller erection.</br></br>
           <span class="font-weight-bold">KSM-66</span> is a well-known plant in Ayurvedic medicine that helps reduce stress and enhances T levels. Stress contributes to a lackluster sex life and premature ejaculation. </br></br>
           <span class="font-weight-bold">Fenugreek</span> is an FDA approved plant that helps restore and renew free testosterone levels, as well as helps lose unwanted fat.</br></br>
           <span class="font-weight-bold">ZMA</span> is Zinc and Magnesium Aspartate. Zinc is an essential mineral needed for growth and in the development of healthy body tissues. It helps sustain the production of testosterone. Magnesium Aspartate is a form of magnesium that is easily absorbed in the body. It helps increase energy levels and is essential for normal cell functioning, bones, muscles, and the heart. Together, ZMA plays a significant role in producing testosterone and encourages your body to create healthy natural hormones.</br></br>
           <span class="font-weight-bold">Tribulus Terrestris</span> helps in sustaining testosterone. It also helps with body-building and enhances athletic performance.</br></br>

Male Ultracore contains 60 % of Icariin extract, the most active component of Horny Weed. Icariin is the purest and best extract that is available in the market that is essential in a man’s sex life.</br></br>
           <span class="font-weight-bold">Maca Root</span> – is a well-known herb supplement that improves a man’s energy and virility. Maca root helps improve stamina and dynamism during sex by reducing the refractory period after an orgasm so you can have more sex. </p>
          <p class="supplementary font-weight-bold pb-2">Supplementary Ingredients</p>  
          <p class="textField3Two"><span class="font-weight-bold">Muira Puama</span> grows in the rainforest of Brazil, Guyana, French Guiana, and Suriname. It is traditionally used as an aphrodisiac and nerve stimulant to help improve erection.</br></br>
